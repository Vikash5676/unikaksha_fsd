                <b>Description:</b> Fortran, formerly FORTRAN, was first
                commercially released in 1957, making it the oldest programming
                language still in use. The programming language was originally
                developed by a team of programmers at IBM led by John Backus. In
                late 1953, Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM
                to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for
                programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer. A year later,
                Fortran was ready for use and was released to the public three
                years later. Fortran quickly changed the computer programming
                landscape and the language has been continuously used for the
                past six decades.

                <b>Description:</b> COBOL, which stands for Common Business
                Oriented Language was developed in 1959 by the Conference on
                Data System Languages (CODASYL). At the time, computer users and
                manufacturers were concerned about the rising cost of
                programming. It was suggested that if a common business-oriented
                language were used, conversion would become cheaper and faster.
                As a result of these concerns and a meeting with the Department
                of Defense, COBOL was born and has since been used primarily in
                business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and
                governments.

            <h3>BASIC</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Year Released:</b> 1964</li>
              <li><b>Designed By:</b> John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz</li>
              <li>
                <b>Description:</b> While all of the programming languages on
                this list changed the world of computers, perhaps none were more
                revolutionary than BASIC (Beginnersâ€™ All-purpose Symbolic
                Instruction Code). First released in 1964 at Dartmouth College
                by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz, BASIC allowed regular
                people, specifically undergraduates in fields other than science
                and mathematics, to program and use computers. BASIC was so easy
                to learn that it eventually became the most widely used computer
                programming language. In the 1980s, use of BASIC declined, but
                there has been renewed interest in the programming language in
                more recent years.

            <h3>Pascal</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Year Released:</b> 1970</li>
              <li><b>Designed By:</b> Niklaus Wirth</li>
              <li>
                <b>Description:</b> Although BASIC was still being taught at
                many colleges, Pascal, developed by Niklaus Wirth, became
                popular with students interested in more serious programming
                skills. Wirth created Pascal to encourage good programming
                practices using structured programming and data structuring.
                Pascal was often used by people who had minicomputers or
                microcomputers. In addition to being used for university-level
                computer programming courses, Pascal was used to write
                commercial software in the late 1970s and 1980s.

                <b>Description:</b> C is another important programming language
                that was widely used for used and influenced several later
                programming languages. A successor to the programming language
                B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie
                between 1972 and 1973 for the new-at-the-time Unix operating
                system. Over the next few years, C was used in many projects
                within the Bell System and also by other research-oriented
                industrial, academic, and government organizations. During the
                1980s, C rose in popularity and went on to become one of the
                most widely used programming languages.
